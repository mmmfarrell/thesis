\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:introduction}

\section{Problem Statement}
As multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular
platforms for commercial and consumer products over the past decade, a variety
of new use cases have emerged that require operation from moving vehicles.
Such use cases include
maritime surveillance, package delivery, and convoy
support (see~\figref{fig:drone_convoy_support}). While there are
many facets to operating from moving vehicles, this thesis works toward creating
a robust solution to autonomously landing multirotor UAVs onto moving vehicles
in challenging conditions.

State-of-the-art autonomous vehicle systems require robust solutions to three
problems: state estimation, motion planning and control. In this thesis,
we propose solutions to two of those three problems, state estimation and
control, for a multirotor UAV landing on a moving vehicle.
% We leave the problem
% of motion planning as future work, providing some suggested direction
% in~\secref{sec:future_work}.

\section{Background}

While autonomous landing of multirotor UAVs onto moving vehicles has been
demonstrated in a variety of scenarios~\cite{wynn2019visual}, many problems still remain to
create a truly robust solution. Here we detail several of these outstanding
problems as they relate to the specifc fields of state estimation, motion
planning, and control.

\subsection{State Estimation}
Most low-cost landing methods assume that the landing vehicle is equipped with a
fiducial marker, such as that shown in~\figref{fig:aruco_tag}, that serves as
the designated landing pad for the UAV.
In these methods, a camera mounted to the UAV detects the fiducial landing marker, providing
information about the relative pose of the landing
vehicle~\cite{borowczyk2017autonomous}. These measurements are often used in a
filtering framework, such as a Kalman filter~\cite{kalman}, to produce a
continous estimate of the relative state between the UAV and the landing
vehicle. However, during landing, it is likely
that the fiducial marker is not detected for periods of time due to occlusion,
sun glare, or UAV motion. For this reason, it is important that the relative
motion between the landing vehicle and the UAV is modeled and used in the  and used to predict
the relative state when the fiducial marker is not detected.
Even with a good model though,
these methods quickly fail when the fiducial landing
marker is not detected for several seconds~\cite{ling2014precision}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{figures/aruco_104.png}
  \caption[Visual Fiducial Landing Marker]{Visual fiducial markers such as this
    ArUco tag~\cite{garrido2016generation} are commonly used to assist in the
  landing of multirotor UAVs onto moving vehicles.}
  \label{fig:aruco_tag}
\end{figure}

When landing in challenging conditions such as strong winds, bright sun, or
dense fog, it is very common that the fiducial marker may be undetected by the UAV
for long periods of time. Therefore, to create a truly robust landing solution,
the state estimation solution must maintain an accurate estimate of the relative
state between the UAV and the landing vehicle when the fiducial landing marker
is not detected for significant durations. Chapter~\ref{chp:estimation_paper}
describes an estimation algorithm, based on the error-state Kalman
filter~\cite{roumeliotis1999circumventing}, that tracks and estimates the locations of
visual features on the landing vehicle to achieve this goal.

Visual feature
tracking and estimation is a common technique in the field of visual
odometry~\cite{qin2018vins}; however, almost all implementations assume that the
tracked visual features are static with respect to an inertial reference frame.
In the landing scenario, the landing vehicle occupies progressively more of the
field of view of the UAV's camera as the UAV descends. We also note that in most
applications, more precise state estimates are required the closer the UAV gets
to the landing vehicle. For these reasons, the described estimation algorithm
only tracks and estimates visual features that are rigidly attached to the landing vehicle.
Experimental results
from both simulation and hardware demonstrate accurate and consistent estimates
result from the proposed algorithm even when the fiducial marker is undetected
for long periods of time.

\subsection{Motion Planning}
The motion planning problem associated with autonomous vehicles is especially
important when the path of the vehicle's motion is critical.
This is commonly the case when
navigating close to obstacles. In the case of landing on moving vehicles, it is
often desired that the UAV descends vertically on the landing pad to avoid
potential obstacles including buildings, terrain, or vehicle superstructure.
When landing on certain vehicles, such as a boat at sea, the specific time of
touchdown may also be important to minimize the risk of damage to the UAV.

Much work has been previously presented in the field of motion planning for
small, multirotor UAVs~\cite{mellinger2011minimum}. Specific methods have also been 
presented that generate paths for a UAV landing on a moving
vehicle by using model-predictive control techniques in real time~\cite{baca2019autonomous}.
% It is likely that one or more of these solutions may be sufficient to create a
% robust landing system.
While we do not propose any improvements to these methods in this thesis, we
describe some potential directions for future work related to motion planning
in~\secref{sec:future_motion_planning}.

\subsection{Control}
% A wide variety of control schemes for multirotor UAVs have been presented over
% the past two decades.
A controller to robustly land a UAV onto a moving vehicle should be able to
accurately track a time-dependent trajectory as described in the previous section.
While many previously presented control algorithms may satisfy the
requirements for robust landing on moving vehicles, there has recently been a
movement in the robotics community to appropriately deal with the evolution of a
robot's state along a manifold using Lie theory~\cite{sola2018micro}. Though
these methods have been widely used in the field of state
estimation~\cite{sola2017quaternion, koch2017relative}, there has not been much
work done applying Lie theory to optimal control.

Chapter~\ref{chp:control_paper} of this thesis derives a
linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) using Lie theory that computes control based on
the error-state dynamics of the system. Not only is this a more principled
approach than previous LQR methods, but it also achieves significant gains in computational efficiency.
Simulation and hardware results show that the derived controller can accurately
track a time-dependent trajectory, making it a good candidate for use in a
robust landing system.

\section{Summary of Contributions}
The research described in this thesis makes two significant contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item A method of state estimation is developed that allows a multirotor UAV to
  continue to operate reliably with respect to a landing vehicle even when a
  fiducial landing marker is not detected for significant periods of time.
% \item A method of state estimation is developed that maintains accurate and
  % consistent estimates of the state of a landing vehicle even when a fiducial landing
  % marker is not detected for significant periods of time by a multirotor UAV.
\item An optimal control scheme for a multirotor UAV is derived using an error-state,
  LQR formulation that enables accurate tracking of any dynamically feasible,
  time-dependent trajectory.
% \item An optimal control scheme for a multirotor UAV is derived in an error-state, linear
  % quadratic regulator (LQR) formulation. This provides an optimal control scheme
  % for a multirotor to follow any dynamically feasible, time-dependent
  % trajectory.
\end{itemize}

These contributions are demonstrated in both simulation and hardware
experiments found in Chapters~\ref{chp:estimation_paper}
and~\ref{chp:control_paper}. These results 
% give us reason to believe that a
show that a
complete and robust landing solution can be created by combining the proposed
state estimation and control schemes with a competent motion planner.
