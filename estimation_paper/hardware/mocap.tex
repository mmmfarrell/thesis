\subsection{Indoor Motion Capture}
The hardware flight experiments were conducted in the indoor motion capture room
in the MAGICC Lab at Brigham Young University. An Optitrack motion capture
system provided meaurements of the global position and attitude of the UAV
throughout the flights. The motion capture system was also used as ground truth
for the position and attitude of the target vehicle.
