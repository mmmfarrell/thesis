\subsection{Fiducial Landing Marker}
The fiducial landing marker used in our flight experiments was a 6.1 cm $\times$ 6.1 cm ArUco
marker~\cite{romero2018speeded}, as pictured in the top, right corner
of~\figref{fig:features_with_aruco}.
% We use an ArUco marker~\cite{romero2018speeded}, as pictured in the upper, right
% of~\figref{fig:features_with_aruco}, for the fiducial landing marker
When detected in a camera image, a relative translation and
rotation from the camera frame to the marker was estimated using the detected positions of
the corners of the marker in the camera image and the known size of the marker. 
% The ArUco library used only detects the marker when it is entirely visible, and
% unobstructed in the camera image.
% Due to these
% conditions, it is not uncommon that the marker may be undetected for significant
% periods of time during a landing maneuver.
