\subsection{Landing Target Vehicle}
As flight tests were conducted in a small indoor environment,
the landing target
vehicle was designed to be small in an attempt to better extend to outdoor
scenarios in which the UAV is to land on larger vehicles such as trucks or boats.
The target vehicle, pictured in~\figref{fig:landing_vehicle}, was manually
driven during the experiments,
roughly following an oval.
