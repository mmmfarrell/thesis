%\subsection{Background}

Over the past two decades, multirotor unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) have become a
popular platform for robotics research and the base for a variety of consumer and
commercial products. UAVs are currently used all over the world for everything
from military surveillance to package delivery. Larger multirotor vehicles
have even been recently introduced to transport humans. Whatever the
application, multirotors must but able to safely navigate in their environment,
requiring a combination of complex perception, motion planning, and control
algorithms. This paper describes a novel control algorithm that allows a multirotor UAV to
accurately track a desired trajectory in time and space.
