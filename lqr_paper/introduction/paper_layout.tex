\secref{sec:model} explains the multirotor UAV model used in the proposed
controller formulation. \secref{sec:lqr_control} presents traditional LQR
theory and shows how the proposed LQR formulation is a natural extension when
care is taken to apply Lie theory to the multirotor problem.
\secref{sec:experiment} describes the experiments used to demonstrate the
proposed control scheme both in simulation and in hardware.
\secref{sec:results} discusses the results of the experiments and
\secref{sec:conclusion} provides concluding remarks.
