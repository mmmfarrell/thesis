\begin{abstract}
  We propose an implementation of an LQR controller for the full-state tracking
  of a time-dependent trajectory with a multirotor UAV. The proposed LQR
  formulation is based in Lie theory and linearized at each time step according
  to the multirotor's current state. We show experiments in both simulation and
  hardware that demonstrate the proposed control scheme's ability to accurately
  reach and track a given trajectory. The implementation is shown to run onboard
  at the full rate of a UAV's estimated state.
