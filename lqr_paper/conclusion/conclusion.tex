%\subsection{Conclusion}

In this work we propose a novel LQR formulation derived from Lie theory. We
show that by using the error-state dynamics, we can properly compute control
using standard linear algebra techniques on vector quantities.
% only on appropriate vector quantities.
Our implementation is
efficient enough to relinearize the system and update the LQR gains in less than
one millisecond. Simulation and hardware experiments show the effectiveness and
simplicity of this control approach.
